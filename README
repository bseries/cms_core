CMS Core
-- Core functionality for Bureau.

Synopsis
--------
Bureau is explicit.

Bureau is an opinionated CMS framework that make several assumptions:

- Caching through memcached; don't hit the filesystem, memcached as the
  most superior caching system.
- Globalization by default - everything will need to be globalized eventually.
- English as the default language.
- Conservativity in database choice; MySql as the default.
- Separation of assets and media; ready for future CDN support.
- Filesystem as  the best storage for files.
- RequireJS for JavaScript dependency managment.

Goals
-----
- Reusability
- Auto-generating administrative interface.
- Provide boilerplate HTML, CSS and JS.
- Fine media management.
- Evolve with requirements becoming more specific to our needs, but stay as
  generic as needed to provide reusability.
- Self-service managment of content[1]

Challenges
----------
- Boilerplate vs. CMS
- One size fits all[1]
- Lowest common denominator[1]

Non-Goals
---------
- Content coupled to technology
- Lock-in(?)
- No in-app query logging; let the database do that for you
- Provide common JS, Apps should not depend on any js provided in the modules.
